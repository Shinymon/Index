            This is a self-made website for my computer repair and upgrade business.
            If you click on the service link below you go to a different page that asks what type of service, you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you pick repair, it will show a form that asks what type of problem is your computer having. If you do not know you can just select the “I do not Know” option.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you pick upgrade, you will have to fill out a form that asks the type and name of the new part that you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also a repair and upgrade option. You will also need to write down all of the pasrt that your pc has for the three forms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The normal pricing for this service is 50$, plus how much I paid for the parts. If you have a budget, please put it in the comments section of the form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the form is filled and submitted, it should take me a day to read it and send an email back.
        </p>
